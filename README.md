# Project : OSM, Photos, and Tours

â€‹	Open Street Map (OSM) is an online map collaboration project for the construction of free content. In this project, we are provided with the processed OSM data, that is, some important attributes extracted from the geotagged photos of Vancouver. In this project, we discussed 4 problems we were interested in, including the urban functional zone problem, where to choose a hotel, the distribution of chain restaurants and non-chain restaurants and tourist attractions recommendation. Throughout the document we explain how we collect and process our data, how we analyze them and what results we got.
